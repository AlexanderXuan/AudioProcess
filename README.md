### Destination

This is a project to show how to analyze the 
audio, and here are two method. In UsingModule
directory, we use "librosa" module to process
audio, if you want using this module, you'd 
better to install "ffmpeg" to process some 
special audio format. In ImplementByHand 
directory, we implement the process code without
special module, otherwise some module we need 
not to implement.

In the future, i will implement some audio algorithm such as speech enhancement, aec, etc.
